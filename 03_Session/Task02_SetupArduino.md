## 1. Setup
First we installed *Arduino UI* to have an easier navigation. Arduino itself has more analog ports.

After that we installed *EspressoLite* following the tutorial at <http://beta.espressolite.com> for setting up

Another good source is available at github. 

github esp8266 arduino

put it in settings additional boards manager URLs

go to serial button
## 2. Flashing
The procedure to flash new data on the *Arudino* is the following
```
press flash
press reset
release flash
release reset
```

Furthermore we need to include the `pubsub library`.
