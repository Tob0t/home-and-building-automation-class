## Info
- Protocol: Session 01_Task1
- Date: 10.05.2016
- Time: 09:00 - 16:00
- Topic: Analyzing Show Times videos

## Szenarios
1. Big Bang Theory
    - Using Computer to switch light on/off
    - Control rc cars by computer
2. Siemens promotion video
    - Turn buildings in living networks => some intellligence?
    - Solutions adapts easily to the needs of the user/building
    - Indoor navigation combined with lighting

## Technologies
1. Big Bang Theory
    - public remote access, access control, remote control light and cars, entertaining with music
2. Siemens promotion video
    - Smart city, standardized interfaces, flexible space, flexible transportation, dynamic security, energy management system
    - open door concepts, personalized assistance, evacuation assistance, detect flows of people by pressure sensors on the floor,
    - energy efficiency, smart grids, intelligent networks
    - standardized interfaces => integration accross multiple domains, monitor accross the network from abroad
    - BYOD => bring you own device => people going with own mobile phone
    - automated parking, mobile devices, smart elevators
    - one central spot of control => privacy?

## Feasability
### What might be doable?
1. Big Bang Theory
    - Everything, time critical things are might not doable yet
2. Siemens promotion video
    - Many technologies are already available (energy efficiency, smart grids, energy management system, ..)

### What not?
1. Big Bang Theory
    - Knowing where to drive that cars remotely, you need low latency
2. Siemens promotion video
    - Dynamich security, open door security, flexible space

### When?
1. Big Bang Theory
    - Now
2. Siemens promotion video
    - Near future

## Weirdness/crazyness
1. Big Bang Theory
    - Crazy
2. Siemens promotion video
    - Innovative
