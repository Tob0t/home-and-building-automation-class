## 1. Setup
In the second task we need to set up a lock controlled by the raspberry. The lock can be opened if it gets a voltage of 12 Volt.

The following items were used
- electronic lock (12 Volt)
- relay working as switch
- LED + resistor

To realize that we need to setup a circuit with a relay which works like a switch by opening and closing the circuit.
To ensure that the lock is working we also put a resistor and a LED in parallel connection.
The following picture is summarizing our work:
